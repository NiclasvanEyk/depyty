# Contributing

This project is developed using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) for dependency
 management and [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) as a task runner.

Once you installed both, you can either run

```shell
just
```

to run a few tasks that validate everything works locally, or run

```shell
just --list
```

to see what tasks are available. Examples include running tests, linting the
code, and generating the documentation.

## Getting Started

If you are getting started and want to explore the library, run

```shell
just docs
```

to view the autogenerated API documentation.
